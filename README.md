### Ray Casting 2D Project
Simple Game written in Java (libGDX) that uses Ray Casting technique

Currently, built using a slow algorithm where for 
each ray the point of intersection is calculated by 
starting from the player and moving forward by a small step 
until it hits a wall or surpasses the maximum draw distance.

In the future the fast DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) 
Algorithm will be implemented to calculate the intersections.

DDA Algorithm was added on 4 November 2022!!!
